Studyinsweden is an organization built and maintained by the Swedish Institute(Svenska Institutet) to the public agency tasked with promoting Sweden for prospective international students abroad. We provide contents regarding the Swedish higher education system, finding and applying for a programme, searching for scholarships, living as an international student in Sweden and learning Swedish.

I was part of blog&Instagram team as a digital ambassador, responsible for writing blog posts for the Study in Sweden blog. Also had a responsibility of managing official Instagram account [@Studyinsweden](https://www.instagram.com/studyinsweden) for posting photos, uploading stories and taking part in Live broadcasts. Also, work with responding to user comments and answer e-mail questions from prospective students.

I enjoy telling stories and communicating with people from different backgrounds, no matter through conversation, text, photography or video. I was grateful to have the opportunity to be part of Studyinsweden as a digital ambassador. It was an inspiring environment to be in a team with people who are full of creative and produce unique, engaging together to make a better content. 

During two years of working with Studyinsweden, I have stepped into areas of the social media within a professional approach. I learned how to read content consumer's need with using Google Analytics, Search Engine Optimization and use this idea to create suitable contents for the platform. Also had a chance to work with a branding strategy that can help feature our materials and make people find more attractions from the product. During the working period, we reached from 20K to 36K Instagram followers with constant interactions.
