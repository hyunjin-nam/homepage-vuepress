I enjoy telling stories and communicating with people from different backgrounds, whether through conversation, text,photography or video. I was grateful to have the opportunity to be part of Studyinsweden as a digital ambassador. It was an inspiring environment to be in a team with people who are full of creative and produce unique, engaging together to make a better content. 

During two years of working with Studyinsweden, I have step into areas of the social media within a professional approach. I learned how to read content consumer's need with using Google Analytics, Search Engine Optimization and use this idea to create suitable content for the platform. Also had a chance to work with a branding strategy that can help feature our materials and make people find more attractions from the product. During the working period, we reached from 20K to 36K Instagram followers with constant interactions.
