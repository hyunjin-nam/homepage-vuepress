## Artificial intelligence in medical diagnositcs
### Internship as an AI developer at Byon8

Byon8 is a health tech company using artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics. With our product AITOPYA, healthcare professionals are provided with diagnostic suggestions from AI engine to ensure secure diagnoses, recommendations and treatments. Also, we are working for de-centralized health care service, currently in the process of providing several services to developing countries such as Uganda. 

As a part of the AI team in Byon8, I have been responsible for data preprocessing,  data mining, and building a predictive model using a wide variety of machine learning models. I had an opportunity to stepped into the industry where I can have hands-on experience in implementing production machine learning systems, and also a solid understanding of ML theory. During the internship, I wrote my Master's thesis about building a tree-based model that can help diagnose diabetes.

## Predicting Diabetes Using Tree-based Methods
### Thesis for degree of Master (Uppsala University, Department of Statistics)

### Abstract 
The aim of this study is to develop a statistical model to predict type 2 diabetes based on the tree-based model. Furthermore, the aim to compare classification with current medical criteria. Used 60,318 patient's data with demographic factors and laboratory measurements from MIMIC III database. 12,933 patients are pre-diagnosed as having diabetes and will implement supervised learning based on tree models. Decision Tree, Random Forest, Boosting with a XGBoost algorithm is used as a classification method to predict diabetes. The results show XGBoost outperformed the two other models in yielding highest classification rate, with a 84.6% test accuracy. However, the two other methods also show relevantly high accuracy, which is comparable with the physician's medical approach. Two interesting findings from this paper are: 1) Ensemble methods such as Random forest and boosting can be easily overfitted on training data, but this problem can be solved with correct hyper-parameter tunning. And 2) Tree-based methods such as XGboost and Random Forest can solve variables' multicollinearity problems.
