## Fj√§llgatans Kaffestuga

This is the best ice-cream place if you are looking for a fine ice-cream with a wide view of Stockholm! This is located right next to the S√∂dermalm's cliff where you can look around the city from the top of the hill! You can find Gamlastan, Gr√∂nalund, a lot of cruises that come all around the world ‚õ¥! Ofc, ice-cream taste so good! I would recommend an Apelsin Choklad and Cheese Cake flavours with v√•fflor! They will put little red jelly on the top of the ice-cream which will make you takes some photos for your Instagram!

## Edsvikens Piazza & Gelateria Norr M√§larstrand

[Theme Song: Marie Ulven - Summer Depression üéß] Sometimes you might feel Stockholm is literally an island, where you can feel bit isolated or lonely for somehow. During this Summer, right after I had finished with my Master's thesis, I felt a bit bored of doing nothing and lost like as a person who has nowhere to go. On one day, I met my previous colleague at this ice-cream store and had a talk about random topics ‚òÄÔ∏è And I felt very much felt relaxed after having ice-cream with her at this place. Taste of the ice-cream is a bit light in a very good way, not too sugary, but lagom sweetness which can refresh you from warm and boring Summer. This place is not so much far away from Stockholm city hall so that you can pass by beautiful architecture on the way as well üö∂‚Äç

## Ben & Jerry

I am sorry to make you disappointed if you were expected me to recommend some unique and authentic ice-cream places. Yes, this is in Gamlastan where it is always crowded with tourist, and where you need to pay more than you will get. But this is Ben and Jerry ü§∑üèª‚Äç I cannot deny this is one of the best ice-cream place in Stockholm!
