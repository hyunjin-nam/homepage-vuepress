Swedish enjoying reading. The graph below shows the countries that read the most. Sweden recorded the list with its citizens reporting an average of 7 hours and 6 minutes a week spent reading. Even though Sweden is not the world most reader, it is still in one of the top countries enjoying reading. As I am from Korea who reads approximately around 3 hours a week according to the graph, the reading difference was quite interesting for me.

he reason why Swedish enjoy reading is hard to figure it out, but the richness of Swedish literature might be one of the reasons why people like to read. There are many famous writers in Sweden. The most representative writer in Sweden is Astrid Lindgren who is best known for childrenâ€™s book series featuring Pippi Longstocking. Also psychological thriller novel â€˜The Girl with the Dragon Tattooâ€™ by Stieg Larsson is well-known. It is the first book of the Millennium series and become an international bestseller. My favourite Swedish Novel is perhaps â€˜The Man Called Oveâ€™ written by Fredrik Backman. Swedish old man called Ove who tried to convince suicide shows us the meaning of life and love.

There are so many places in Sweden where you can enjoy reading. Not only the public or university library, there are also various independent bookstores and secondhand bookstores all over Sweden. It is really fun to find unique bookstores which really matches with my own taste of reading.

In this post, I would like to introduce some bookstores in Sweden where I really enjoy to go. Hope you guys also like bookstores that I will introduce below. And for sure, you can come to Sweden and experience not only those bookstores but also find more places by yourself. If you know any other great bookstores, please feel free to post comments on below and share with us!



## Serieslussen Comicstrip
### Bellmansgatan 26, 118 47 Stockholm

This is a comic book store where classic comic lovers would like to go. Since this is second-hand bookstores, the prices were quite affordable, comic book starting from 10 Kroner. I guess it can be the easy and nice way to start learning Swedish with those old Swedish comic books!

## PoesihÃ¶rnan
### Mariatorget 7-3, 118 48 Stockholm

Unfortunately, this place has only a few English books in this stores. If you can read in Swedish, then you will really like this bookstore. Still, there were many books that attracted me even only with the book cover.
