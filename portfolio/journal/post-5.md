Hyunjin and Jakob, 2023  

# Restaurants
### 사대부집 곳간 (Sadebujip Gotkan)
Please go here! Our favorite restaurant. This building is known as a sustainable building, having solar panels surrounding the entire building, as well as having a rooftop garden. You can enjoy authentic Korean traditional food with a side dish salad bar on the 55th floor. You can also drop by The Hyundai department store after having lunch/dinner here 🙂  

Recommend menu: 전복갈비찜 60,000 won  

### 황생가 칼국수 (Hwangsenga Kalguksu)
칼국수 (Kalguksu) is Korean traditional food made in a husmanskost style that people eat as everyday food. It is similar to Udon but using a beef broth. This restaurant is listed in the Michelin guide as an affordable restaurant where one dish costs around 11,000 krw. Even if you go there as one person, I would like to recommend eat two dishes which are noodle and dumpling. It is like a set in Korea to eat 칼국수 noodle together with Kimchi and dumpling.  

 Recommend menu: 사골칼국수 (Sagul Kalguksu) 11,000 won, 왕만두(Wangmandu) 11,000 won together as a set.

### 맘스터치 (Mom’s Touch)
We know it sounds weird. Hyunjin’s favorite student food. It is a really tasty hamburger franchise. I love chicken burgers and it is impossible to find a chicken burger as good as this one in Stockholm. If you want to have just McDonald's, then please rather go here. They have many different locations all over Seoul. 🙂  

Recommend menu: 싸이버거 (thigh burger) 6,900 won  
Location: Anywhere close to you

### 교촌필방 (Kyochon pilbang)
This is the best chicken delivery place. My favorite menu is Honey Combo 😃

### 목멱산방 남산타워점 
One of the best places in Seoul to get a traditional bibimbap. The restaurant is inside an old temple on the Namsan mountain where you can also get a beautiful view of the city. The price is surprisingly affordable for the high-quality food and amazing location.  

Recommended menu: Bulgogi bibimbap (12,500 won)

### 차마시는 뜰 (Chamasinun Tul)
Hyunjin’s favorite tea house. Tea house with traditional Korean architecture. Really cozy and you can also learn the traditional Korean tea ceremony 🙂

Recommend Menu: Anything you want to try

### 청수당공명 (Chongsudan Gongmyong)
Jakob’s memorable cafe. This area is a typical neighborhood where people in their 20s hang out. It is a little bit similar to Södermalm. It’s really fun to just get lost in the narrow streets and walk down some random alley. Jakob enjoyed the indoor small garden in this place 🙂  

Recommend menu: 공명3단 트레이 15,000 won  
Link: https://naver.me/xKQcnmKY  

### 설빙 (Sarbing)
Korean traditional dessert place for 팥빙수 (Packpingsu). 팥빙수 (Packpingsu) is Korean style ice cream which is basically sliced ice with red bean paste. 설빙 (Sarbing) offers more modern variations popular with young people. They have tastes like Mango 빙수, Strawberry 빙수, etc. 🙂  

Location: Anywhere close to you  
Recommend Menu: Anything you want to try

### 텔러스 9.5 (Tellus 9.5)
Another bar with a great view! There are a lot of good bars with beautiful views in Seoul, so please check them out! This place works as a cafe during the day, so it can be an option to come here for a fika 😊  

Price: Coffee 8,000 won, Beer 15,000 won

# Places to Visit
### 더 현대 (The Hyundai Department Store)
The Hyundai Department Store is the go-to place for shopping in Seoul. This place has been open for a few years and quickly become the go-to place for shopping, especially for people in their 20s and 30s. They have a variety of stores and not only for clothes but also it’s really fun to look around the huge food section. Highly recommend visiting here, especially B1 where there are a lot of food stores and B2 where there are a lot of pop-up stores. Vezzly is Jakob’s favorite bakery located in The Hyundai. His favorite is a fika bread called ‘멜론빵(Melon pang)’ 🙂  

Recommend stores: Vezzly (bakery), Andar (unisex clothing)

### 인왕산 (Inwang san mountain)
This is a place Jakob went for hiking. You get a really good view over Seoul. As far as I remember, I hiked through Inwangsan section which is the purple color in the map below. The section starting from the site of Donuimun and passing through Woram Neighborhood Park and Inwangsan Sunseong-gil to Changuimun Gate.

### 도토리 캐리커쳐 (Acorn Caricature)
Cute small store where they draw your pictures. They draw you in a few minutes for only 7,000 won. Unfortunately, Jakob does not look at all like what they drew, but it's a fun experience you can have at an affordable price. 🙂  

Price: 7,000 won

# Touristy Places
### 국립 중앙 박물관 (National museum)
Great museum which covers the history of Korea. 🙂

### 전쟁 기념관 (The war memorial of Korea)
Well-made museum, mainly about the Korean war. Recommend the guided tour in English. You can check out tanks, flights and many different items that were used in the war.

### 경복궁 (Gyeongbokgung Place)
The main palace. If you plan to visit any palace this should be your top priority. 🙂  
Link: https://naver.me/FLBKTWSB

### 국립현대미술관 서울 (National Museum of Modern and Contemporary art)
Modern Art museum. Some of the exhibitions are free, so good to check out. The stores inside and cafe (Terarosa) are nice so have a quick sneak peek when you are walking by.

### Everland (w. Caribbean Bay)
Everland is the largest theme park in Korea, a place I spend a lot of good time during my youthful years with my friends and family. There are both rides and a zoo in Everland and right beside it lies Caribbean Bay, a water park. It's possible to buy a single ticket for access to both parks. I would like to recommend try hop on a safari bus for an up-close look at lions, bears, and giraffes!  
Recommend rides: T익스프레스(T Express), 사파리 월드(Safari World), 로스트 벨리(Lost Valley)

### 리움미술관
One of our favorite art museums in Seoul. It is owned by Samsung's chairperson who had a great interest in art, and it contains pieces from his private collection.

### 디앤디파트먼트
They have many items that are either traditional or widely used or trendy.  
Link: 

### 오브젝트
We Koreans love small cute stationery! You will find small design goods here.

## Good to Know
### Naver Maps
Koreans don’t use Google Maps. There is not as much information available on Google Maps, especially if you’re looking for a review. Also, the maps in Google Maps are not updated frequently due to national safety reasons. We recommend using Naver Maps if you are searching for anything.

### Kakao taxi
Uber but Korean version. Uber is not available but Kakao taxi is the most common way to catch a taxi 😊  
Link to app store:  

### Airalo
App for ESim. Jakob bought an e-sim card from the app. Good price, easy to use not only for Korea but also anywhere abroad.
