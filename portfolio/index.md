## Experience
 **Byon8** *Jan 2019 - Present* 
 `AI Developer`
 ##### Byon8 is a health tech company using artificial intelligence in medical diagnostics. With our product AITOPYA, healthcare professionals are provided with diagnostic suggestions from AI engine to ensure secure diagnoses, recommendations and treatments. Also, we are working for de-centralized health care service, currently in the process of providing several services to developing countries such as Uganda.

##### As a part of the AI team in Byon8, I have been responsible for data preprocessing, data mining, and building a predictive model using a wide variety of machine learning models. This has given me the opportunity to step into the industry, have hands-on experience in implementing production machine learning systems, and gain a solid understanding of machine learning theory. During the internship, I wrote my Master's thesis about building a tree-based model that can help diagnose diabetes.

**Svenska Institutet**  *Sep 2017 - Jun 2019* 
`Digital Ambassador`
##### Studyinsweden is an organization built and maintained by the swedish institute(svenska institutet) and is tasked with promoting Sweden for prospective international students abroad. We provide contents regarding the Swedish higher education system, finding and applying for a programme, searching for scholarships, living as an international student in Sweden and learning Swedish.

##### I was part of blog and Instagram team as a digital ambassador, responsible for writing blog posts for the Study in Sweden blog. Also My responsibilities included managing the official instagram   \href{https://www.instagram.com/studyinsweden/}{@Studyinsweden} for posting photos, uploading stories and taking part in Live broadcasts. I also responded to user comments and answer e-mail questions from prospective students.
