Please let us know if you have any questions or need more recommendations. We are more than happy to share our opinion with you.<br>
Hope you’ll have a wonderful time in Seoul ☀</p> <p>Hyunjin and Jakob, 2023</p> <h1 id="restaurants">Restaurants</h1> <h3 id="사대부집-곳간-sadebujip-gotkan">사대부집 곳간 (Sadebujip Gotkan)</h3> <p>Please go here! Our favorite restaurant. This building is known as a sustainable building, having solar panels surrounding the entire building, as well as having a rooftop garden. You can enjoy authentic Korean traditional food with a side dish salad bar on the 55th floor. You can also drop by The Hyundai department store after having lunch/dinner here 🙂</p> <p>Recommend menu: 전복갈비찜 60,000 won</p> <h3 id="황생가-칼국수-hwangsenga-kalguksu">황생가 칼국수 (Hwangsenga Kalguksu)</h3> <p>칼국수 (Kalguksu) is Korean traditional food made in a husmanskost style that people eat as everyday food. It is similar to Udon but using a beef broth. This restaurant is listed in the Michelin guide as an affordable restaurant where one dish costs around 11,000 krw. Even if you go there as one person, I would like to recommend eat two dishes which are noodle and dumpling. It is like a set in Korea to eat 칼국수 noodle together with Kimchi and dumpling.</p> <p>Recommend menu: 사골칼국수 (Sagul Kalguksu) 11,000 won, 왕만두(Wangmandu) 11,000 won together as a set.</p> <p>Link: <a href="https://m.place.naver.com/share?id=11679429&amp;tabsPath=/home&amp;appMode=detail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">황생가 칼국수<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <h3 id="맘스터치-mom-s-touch">맘스터치 (Mom’s Touch)</h3> <p>We know it sounds weird. Hyunjin’s favorite student food. It is a really tasty hamburger franchise. I love chicken burgers and it is impossible to find a chicken burger as good as this one in Stockholm. If you want to have just McDonald's, then please rather go here. They have many different locations all over Seoul. 🙂</p> <p>Recommend menu: 싸이버거 (thigh burger) 6,900 won<br>
Location: Anywhere close to you</p> <h3 id="교촌필방-kyochon-pilbang">교촌필방 (Kyochon pilbang)</h3> <p>This is the best chicken delivery place.

The restaurant is inside an old temple on the Namsan mountain where you can also get a beautiful view of the city. The price is surprisingly affordable for the high-quality food and amazing location.</p> <p>Recommended menu: Bulgogi bibimbap (12,500 won)<br>

Tea house with traditional Korean architecture. Really cozy and you can also learn the traditional Korean tea ceremony 🙂</p> <p>Link: https://m.place.naver.com/share?id=11719309&amp;tabsPath=%2Fhome&amp;appMode=detail</p> <p>Recommend Menu: Anything you want to try</p> <h3 id="청수당공명-chongsudan-gongmyong">청수당공명 (Chongsudan Gongmyong)</h3> <p>Jakob’s memorable cafe. This area is a typical neighborhood where people in their 20s hang out. It is a little bit similar to Södermalm. It’s really fun to just get lost in the narrow streets and walk down some random alley. Jakob enjoyed the indoor small garden in this place 🙂</p> <p>Recommend menu: 공명3단 트레이 15,000 won<br>
Link: https://naver.me/xKQcnmKY</p> <h3 id="설빙-sarbing">설빙 (Sarbing)</h3> <p>Korean traditional dessert place for 팥빙수 (Packpingsu). 팥빙수 (Packpingsu) is Korean style ice cream which is basically sliced ice with red bean paste. 설빙 (Sarbing) offers more modern variations popular with young people. They have tastes like Mango 빙수, Strawberry 빙수, etc. 🙂</p> <p>Location: Anywhere close to you<br>
Recommend Menu: Anything you want to try</p> <h3 id="텔러스-9-5-tellus-9-5">텔러스 9.5 (Tellus 9.5)</h3> <p>Another bar with a great view! There are a lot of good bars with beautiful views in Seoul, so please check them out! This place works as a cafe during the day, so it can be an option to come here for a fika 😊</p> <p>Price: Coffee 8,000 won, Beer 15,000 won<br>

This place has been open for a few years and quickly become the go-to place for shopping, especially for people in their 20s and 30s. They have a variety of stores and not only for clothes but also it’s really fun to look around the huge food section. Highly recommend visiting here, especially B1 where there are a lot of food stores and B2 where there are a lot of pop-up stores. Vezzly is Jakob’s favorite bakery located in The Hyundai. His favorite is a fika bread called ‘멜론빵(Melon pang)’ 🙂</p> <p>Recommend stores: Vezzly (bakery), Andar (unisex clothing)<br>

You get a really good view over Seoul. As far as I remember, I hiked through Inwangsan section which is the purple color in the map below. The section starting from the site of Donuimun and passing through Woram Neighborhood Park and Inwangsan Sunseong-gil to Changuimun Gate.<br>
Link: https://naver.me/5eGTvcXC</p> <h3 id="도토리-캐리커쳐-acorn-caricature">도토리 캐리커쳐 (Acorn Caricature)</h3> <p>Cute small store where they draw your pictures. They draw you in a few minutes for only 7,000 won. Unfortunately, Jakob does not look at all like what they drew, but it's a fun experience you can have at an affordable price. 🙂</p> <p>Price: 7,000 won<br>

Link: https://naver.me/5eGTvcXC</p> <h3 id="everland-w-caribbean-bay">Everland (w. Caribbean Bay)</h3> <p>Everland is the largest theme park in Korea, a place I spend a lot of good time during my youthful years with my friends and family. There are both rides and a zoo in Everland and right beside it lies Caribbean Bay, a water park. It's possible to buy a single ticket for access to both parks. I would like to recommend try hop on a safari bus for an up-close look at lions, bears, and giraffes!<br>

Link:</p> <h2 id="good-to-know">Good to Know</h2> <h3 id="naver-maps">Naver Maps</h3> <p>Koreans don’t use Google Maps. There is not as much information available on Google Maps, especially if you’re looking for a review. Also, the maps in Google Maps are not updated frequently due to national safety reasons. We recommend using Naver Maps if you are searching for anything.<br>
Link to Naver Map:</p> <h3 id="kakao-taxi">Kakao taxi</h3> <p>Uber but Korean version. Uber is not available but Kakao taxi is the most common way to catch a taxi 😊<br>
Link to app store:</p> <h3 id="airalo">Airalo</h3> <p>App for ESim.
